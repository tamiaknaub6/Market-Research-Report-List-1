<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Diamonds for Jewelry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD</li><li>HPHT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic diamonds for jewelry are primarily produced through two methods: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT). CVD involves creating diamonds in a lab by depositing carbon gases onto a substrate, resulting in high-quality, gem-grade diamonds. In contrast, HPHT simulates the natural conditions under which diamonds form, using intense pressure and heat to crystallize carbon. Both methods yield diamonds with similar physical and chemical properties to natural ones, offering an ethical and often more affordable alternative in the jewelry market.</p></p>
